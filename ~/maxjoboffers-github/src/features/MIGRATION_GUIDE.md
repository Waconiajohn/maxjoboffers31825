# Migration Guide: Moving to Feature-Based Architecture

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating code from the current technical-type-based structure to the new feature-based architecture.

## Overview

We're transitioning from organizing code by technical type (components, services, types, etc.) to organizing by business domain (job, interview, linkedin, etc.). This will improve maintainability, encapsulation, navigation, scalability, and team collaboration.

## Migration Process

### 1. Identify Features

First, identify the main features of the application:

- **job**: Job search and tracking functionality
- **interview**: Interview preparation functionality
- **linkedin**: LinkedIn profile optimization
- **resources**: Resource library and events
- **retirement**: Retirement planning
- ... (add any other features)

### 2. Create Feature Directories

For each feature, create a directory structure following the pattern:

```
src/features/feature-name/
├── components/
├── services/
├── types/
├── api/ (if needed)
├── utils/ (if needed)
├── hooks/ (if needed)
├── context/ (if needed)
├── ai/ (if needed)
├── index.ts
└── README.md
```

### 3. Move Files

For each feature, move the relevant files from the current structure to the new feature directories:

#### Example: Job Feature

1. Move job-related types:
   - From: `src/types/jobSearch.ts`, `src/types/jobTracking.ts`
   - To: `src/features/job/types/index.ts`

2. Move job-related services:
   - From: `src/services/jobSearch.ts`, `src/services/jobTracking.ts`
   - To: `src/features/job/services/jobSearchService.ts`, `src/features/job/services/jobTrackingService.ts`

3. Move job-related components:
   - From: `src/components/jobSearch/JobSearchBoard.tsx`, etc.
   - To: `src/features/job/components/JobSearchBoard.tsx`, etc.

#### Example: Interview Feature

1. Move interview-related types:
   - From: `src/types/interviewPrep.ts`
   - To: `src/features/interview/types/interviewPrep.ts`

2. Move interview-related services:
   - From: `src/services/interviewPrep.ts`
   - To: `src/features/interview/services/interviewPrep.ts`

3. Move interview-related components:
   - From: `src/components/interview/InterviewPrepDashboard.tsx`, etc.
   - To: `src/features/interview/components/InterviewPrepDashboard.tsx`, etc.

4. Move interview-related AI prompts:
   - From: `src/ai/interviewPrompts.ts`
   - To: `src/features/interview/ai/interviewPrompts.ts`

### 4. Update Imports

Update all import statements throughout the codebase to reference the new file locations:

#### Before:

```tsx
import { Job } from 'src/types/jobSearch';
import { jobSearchService } from 'src/services/jobSearch';
import JobSearchBoard from 'src/components/jobSearch/JobSearchBoard';
```

#### After:

```tsx
import { Job } from 'src/features/job';
import { jobSearchService } from 'src/features/job';
import { JobSearchBoard } from 'src/features/job';
```

### 5. Create Feature Index Files

For each feature, create an `index.ts` file that exports all the feature's components, services, and types:

```tsx
// src/features/job/index.ts

// Export types
export * from './types';

// Export services
export { jobSearchService } from './services/jobSearchService';
export { jobTrackingService } from './services/jobTrackingService';

// Export components
export { default as JobSearchBoard } from './components/JobSearchBoard';
export { default as JobTrackingDashboard } from './components/JobTrackingDashboard';
// ... export other components
```

### 6. Create Feature README Files

For each feature, create a `README.md` file that documents the feature's purpose, structure, and usage:

```markdown
# Job Feature

This feature module provides job search and tracking functionality for the MaxJobOffers application.

## Overview

The job feature helps users find and track job opportunities by:

1. Searching and filtering job listings
2. Tracking job applications
3. Receiving job recommendations
...

## Directory Structure

...

## Usage

...

## Types

...

## Components

...

## Services

...
```

### 7. Update App Component

Update the main App component to import components from the new feature modules:

```tsx
// src/components/App.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Layout } from './ui/Layout';

// Import from feature modules
import { JobSearchBoard, JobTrackingDashboard } from 'src/features/job';
import { InterviewDashboard } from 'src/features/interview';
import { LinkedInProfileEditor } from 'src/features/linkedin';
import { ResourceLibrary } from 'src/features/resources';
import { RetirementDashboard } from 'src/features/retirement';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Layout>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/jobs" element={<JobSearchBoard />} />
          <Route path="/job-tracking" element={<JobTrackingDashboard />} />
          <Route path="/interview" element={<InterviewDashboard />} />
          <Route path="/linkedin" element={<LinkedInProfileEditor />} />
          <Route path="/resources" element={<ResourceLibrary />} />
          <Route path="/retirement" element={<RetirementDashboard />} />
          {/* ... other routes */}
        </Routes>
      </Layout>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phased Approach

To minimize disruption, consider a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Set up the feature directory structure and create the main README.md
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate one feature at a time, starting with smaller, less complex features
3. **Phase 3**: Update imports and ensure everything works correctly
4. **Phase 4**: Clean up any remaining references to the old structure

### Testing

After migrating each feature:

1. Run all tests to ensure functionality still works
2. Manually test the feature in the application
3. Fix any issues before moving on to the next feature

### Documentation

As you migrate each feature:

1. Create a README.md file for the feature
2. Document any changes to the API or usage
3. Update any existing documentation to reflect the new structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

- **Improved Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together, making it easier to understand and modify
- **Better Encapsulation**: Features are self-contained, reducing coupling between unrelated parts
- **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find all code related to a specific feature
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing ones
- **Team Collaboration**: Teams can work on different features with minimal conflicts

## Best Practices

- Keep features focused on a specific business domain
- Minimize dependencies between features
- Use shared components and utilities for common functionality
- Document each feature's purpose, structure, and usage in its README.md
- Export all public APIs through the feature's index.ts file
- Use consistent naming conventions across features
